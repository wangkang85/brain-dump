The Objectives:
1. I can better understand myself and most importantly check whether my efforts are aligned with my values.
2. I can iterate on them efficiently,
	- incorporating other people's principles; 
	- rectifying my principles through new experience/data; 
	- consolidating multiple specific ones into a general one.
3. I can make our decisions much faster and more consistently.
4. Someone or even a machine can make the same decision as me, but without me.
