General Principles
- Principles outlive tactics.
- I can’t change things out of my control, but I can change my attitude towards them.
- The only thing that never changes is change. Thus, learn to be resilient to it.
- Define the purpose of life and let it be the ultimate driver for my moves.
- Past experiences and learnings are not sunk cost; they are the most valuable assets that can be activated by my next move.
- Think of life as an infinite game, which doesn't end when certain goals are met, but rather continues to challenge myself.
- It's fine to use goals as milestones, but don't get obsessed by them; focus on building a process to get there.
- Examine the goals and discern which ones are the causes and which ones are the consequences. Focus on the former.
- The key to become a shaper is to be determined and self-skeptical at the same time.
- Follow the light as bees strategically, try and err like ants tactically.
- Validate and refine hypotheses on a small scale before applying them on a big scale.
- Don't be afraid of being a minority. Extraordinary rewards only come when being right and being a minority at the same time.
- Build a feedback loop for any betterment - record, measure, reflect, refine and so on.
- Build a cognitive map (about the known unknowns) before building a knowledge graph (about the known knowns).
- Reduce uncertainty through decomposition.
- Fundamental skills (e.g., mental models, math) over trendy skills.
- Adapt to survive; differentiate to thrive.
- Thoughtful and skeptical during decision making, focused and steady during execution.
- The most sophisticated designer is one who designs the rules that govern evolution.
- Reduce fear by planning for the worst case and practicing the contingency plan.
- Spend 80% of the time on the career even though it may only contribute to 20% of the income, because only skills can never be taken away.
- Judge the impact of historical events from the civilization's perspective, not from the individual's perspective.
- Don't get obsessed by simple and elegant models; embrace the data-driven approach on complex problems.
- Don't simply take the mid-point between two opposing poles; learn and apply the most appropriate extreme case by case.
- Don't let bland equanimity replace the passion that leads to both strengths and weaknesses; just moderate the weaknesses.
- Being loyal does not mean strictly obeying one's order but wholeheartedly serving one's best interest.

Decision-making Principles
- A rational decision is essentially optimizing the objectives on top of well-defined constraints (bottom lines).
- Making optimal decisions is not exclusive to human beings; making deliberate suboptimal decisions is and it is so to each individual.
- Listen to the majority (on mental models and not opinions), discuss with the minority (on decision frameworks), and decide alone (based on one's own deduction and value system).
- Documenting the decision process has two benefits: (1) writing is a tool for thinking, (2) articulation enables future improvement.
- Thoughtful opinions held loosely - the reality is the ultimate judge of truth.
- Think big but move in baby steps.
- For events that have catastrophic consequences, try to eliminate their possibilities or constrain their impact, instead of lowering their probabilities.
- For critical and rare decisions, think from the perspective of the bigger group and even human civilization.
- When making an impactful decision under high uncertainty, perfer the alternative with high reversibility.
- In retrospect, consider the effect of randomness when assigning credit to skill and luck.
- Think like AlphaGo - every move is based on the latest situation and has nothing to do with previous decisions.

Investment Principles
- Investment is an epistemic game, where the monetary gain is simply a by-product of epistemic development.
- Investment is an infinite game, where the goal is not to reach a specific amount. Rather, it is meant to grow the portfolio and refine the kernel.
- Precision over recall: wait for the pitch you want, so you can swing with high accuracy and sufficient resources.
- Articulate the goal(s) (yield, liquidity, volatility, hedging, etc) before making each investment; evaluate the success of the investment by and only by its own goal.
- There is no such thing as an exit strategy in investment - you sell your investment when you need the cash or find a better opportunity.
- Trade with a rationale - articulate and document the goals, constraints, hypotheses, alternatives and expectation of alternatives.
- Evaluate a decision by its decision process instead of its outcome - good decisions don't guarantee good outcomes and bad decisions might produce good outcomes. The latter is much more dangerous.
- A good decision is characterized by thoughtful consideration of alternatives (in terms of potential outcome and odds) and picking the most promising one.
- Only invest in positive-sum games (such as stocks and bounds); never invest in zero-sum games (such as commodities and currencies).
- Stay precautious about options - predicting the timing is much harder than predicting the trend.
- Phenomenal growth only happens to very few companies. Thus, the secret of investment is to find places where it's safe and wise to non-diversify.
- Highly rewarding opportunities generally arise when people haven't noticed a big breakthrough yet, which often lies in the shift from Early Adopter to Early Majority.
- Limit the exposure of each asset by Kelly criterion.
- You can’t hedge, but you can diversify.
- Assets whose potential return is bounded but potential loss is unbounded (i.e., concave) should be avoided at all costs.
- Don't try to time the market. Instead, set an upper bound for the price and keep buying in a fixed schedule.
- Stay aware of the reflexivity: good or bad outcomes will get intensified, driven by human nature and enabled by derivatives.
- Feedback loops matter: a company that has established a close feedback loop has the potential of exponential growth.

Business Principles
- Define the company by its mission, which is ultimately satisfying a demand of the society.
- The demand must be long-lasting or everlasting.
- The demand must align with mainstream values of human society.
- The demand must be large or even infinite.
- A successful company must form its virtuous cycle, which starts from establishing a closed feedback loop.
- Once a positive feedback loop is discovered, focus on the first cause, the step which we have the most control on.
- Adopt different strategies at different stages over the path of company growth.
- Accept and embrace the seemingly chaos, as long as everyone is clear about the goal.
- Dream big and pivot as necessary.
- Focus on the true essence of the product - get three key features very very right and forget about everything else.
- An effective competitive strategy is a strategy that your competitor can't react to, due to either incapability or not congruent with its core competence.

Management Principles
- Select for attitude, train for skills.
- Reward more for success than efforts.
- Once the business is steady, a company should focus on earning and move to a healthy state financially in baby steps. Otherwise, a dramatic price change motivated by profitability would cause friction and disgust from the customers.

Leadership Principles
- Categorize decisions by their reversibility and consequentiality.
    - Leave inconsequential decisions to junior people, because the growth of people outweighs the value of the decisions themselves.
    - Leave reversible and consequential decisions to senior people, because the decisions can be well handled and possibly leads to knowledge expansion.
    - Leave irreversible and consequential decisions to the best and most responsible people.
- Tell the story before the battle; share the relection after the battle.

Meeting Principles
- Share context and make sure that everyone is on the same page before further reasoning.
- Articulate the decision framework which is essentially the principle driving the decision.
- Discuss whether the principle aligns with the value we share.
- Apply the principles to derive the right decisions.
- Share the meeting notes organized in the MECE principle (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive).

Friendship Principles
- Character over merit.
- Facing life challenges with adaptability, tenacity and resilience, instead of complaints.
