General Principles
- I canâ€™t change things outside of my control, but I can change my attitude.
- The means has serve the end; don't get distracted by nice but useless things.
- Set a clear goal but don't focus on the goal itself; focus on building a process to get there.
- Categorize decisions by their reversibility and consequentiality.
    - Leave inconsequential decisions to junior people, so they can develop judgment.
    - Leave reversible and consequential decisions to senior people, so they can run experiments, collect information and present their findings.
    - Leave irreversible and consequential decisions to the best and most responsible people.
- When making irreversible and consequential decisions, write down my thinking process in decision journal and review them in post-mortem.
- Take risks systematically and scientifically.
- Build a feedback loop for any betterment. Record and measure first, follwed by retrospection and reflection.
- Principles outlive tactics.
- Thoughtful opinions held loosely - reality is the ultimate judge of objectivity.
- Focus on things (knowledge, skills, business, etc) that are fundamental and tend to last beyond 10 years.
- Stay simple and aware of 80/20 rule.
- Think far and big, move in baby steps.
- Judge things from the civilization's perspective, not from the individual's perspective.
- Knowing something's existence and how to find it is more useful than knowing something itself.
- Adaptability over vision. Failures are more often due to unable or unwilling to adapt, rather than unable to predict.
- Reflect during the pain (ideally) or after the pain (at least).
- A process to solve almost all problems: Goals - Problems - Root Cause Diagnosis - Solution Design - Doing.
- Skeptical during planning, steady during execution.
- Reduce fear by planning for the worst case and practicing the contingency plan.

Investment Principles
- The purpose of hedging is to reduce the variance, at the cost of slightly reduced mean.
- Diversify among different evaluation methods (short-term earning, long-term growth, etc).
- Diversify between horizontal-integration (infrastructure centric) companies and vertical-integration (solution-centric) companies.

Management Principles:
- Select for attitude, train for skills.
- Reward more to success than efforts.
- Once the business is steady, company should focus on earning and move to a healthy state financially in baby steps. Otherwise, a dramatic change for the sake of earning will cause friction and disgust from the users.
