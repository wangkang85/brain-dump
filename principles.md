General Principles
- I canâ€™t change things out of my control, but I can change my attitude towards them.
- Set clear goals but don't get obsessed by the goals; focus on building a process to get there.
- The means has to serve the end; don't get distracted by nice but inessential things.
- Follow the light as bees strategically, try and err like ants tactically.
- Think big while moving in baby steps.
- Verify and refine hypotheses on a small scale; apply the validated ones on a big scale.
- Principles outlive tactics.
- Extraordinary rewards only come with being right and being a minority at the same time.
- Those choices that were not optimal for certain utility but served certain meaning actually defined us.
- A wise decision can only be made on top of well-defined constraints (bottom lines) and objectives.
- Build a feedback loop for any betterment - record, measure, reflect, refine and so on.
- Measure with a purpose or hypothesis in mind.
- Thoughtful opinions held loosely - reality is the ultimate judge of objectivity.
- Known unknowns are at least equal to or sometimes more valuable than known knowns.
- Reduce uncertainty through a decomposition on how to get there.
- Stay focused by being aware of the 80/20 rule.
- For consequential decisions, document the decision process so the decision framework can be refined in the future.
- Focus on learning the fundamentals (mental models and basic skills), which can be valuablefor a long time.
- Adaptability over vision. Failures are more often due to unable or unwilling to adapt, rather than unable to predict.
- Adapt to survive; differentiate to thrive.
- Thoughtful and skeptical during decision making, focused and steady during execution.
- Try to become a designer of rules, instead of a builder of things - good things will organically evolve from good rules, but not vice versa.
- Design things with reversibility in mind - if this decision turns out to be wrong, how can we make it less painful to rectify it?
- Reduce fear by planning for the worst case and practicing the contingency plan.
- Seize the fate through the mastering of probabilities.
- Judge the impact of historical events from the civilization's perspective, not from the individual's perspective.
- For critical and rare decisions, think from the perspective of the bigger group and even human civilization.

Investment Principles
- Investment is an epistemic game, where the gain is simply a by-product of validated hypotheses.
- Investment is an "infinite" game, where the goal is not to make a certain amount of money and call it done. Rather, the goal is to grow the portfolio and know deeper about myself.
- Articulate the goal(s) (yield, liquidity, volatility, hedging, etc) before each investment; evaluate the success of the investment by and only by its own goal.
- Trade always with a rationale - articulate and document the goals, constraints, hypotheses, alternatives and expectation of alternatives.
- Build my own decision framework and keep refining it through the evaluation of previous decisions.
- Evaluate a decision by its decision process, not by its outcome - a good decision doesn't necessarily produce a good outcome and a bad decision may still produce a good outcome. The latter is much more dangerous.
- A good decision is characterized by thoughtful consideration of alternatives (in terms of potential outcome and odds) and picking the most promising one.
- Only invest in positive-sum games (such as stocks and bounds); never invest in zero-sum games (such as commodities and currencies).
- Stay precautious about options - predicting the trend is much easier than predicting the timing.
- Phenomenal growth only happens to very few companies. Thus, the secret of investment is to find places where it's safe and wise to non-diversify.
- Highly rewarding opportunities generally arise when people haven't noticed a big breakthrough yet, which is often coupled with the shift from Early Adopter to Early Majority.
- Limit the exposure of each asset by Kelly criterion.
- The purpose of hedging is to make sure that part of the portfolio can be disposed without a loss at any given point.
- Assets whose potential return is bounded but potential loss is unlimited should be avoided at all costs.
- Don't try to time the market. Instead, buy or sell in a Bayesian way - start with a small bet given a hypothesis and adjust the bet based on market feedback.
- Stay aware of disposition effect; good or bad outcomes generally get extremized, which is driven by human nature and enabled by derivatives.

Business Principles
- Define the company by its mission, which is ultimately to satisfy a demand of the society.
- The demand is long-lasting or everlasting.
- The demand aligns with mainstream values of human society.
- The demand is large or even infinite.
- Adopt different strategies at different stages over the path of company growth.
- Accept and embrace the seemingly chaos, as long as the goal is highly aligned.

Management Principles
- Select for attitude, train for skills.
- Reward more to success than efforts.
- Once the business is steady, a company should focus on earning and move to a healthy state financially in baby steps. Otherwise, a dramatic price change motivated by profitability would cause friction and disgust from the customers.
- Categorize decisions by their reversibility and consequentiality.
    - Leave inconsequential decisions to junior people, because the growth of people outweighs the value of the decisions themselves.
    - Leave reversible and consequential decisions to senior people, because the decisions can be well handled and possibly leads to knowledge expansion.
    - Leave irreversible and consequential decisions to the best and most responsible people.

Meeting Principles
- A good process will help us deliver the goal, but not vice vera.
- Share context and make sure that everyone is on the same page before further reasoning.
- Articulate the decision framework which is essentially the principle driving the decision.
- Discuss whether the principle aligns with the value we share.
- Apply the principles to derive the right decisions.

Friendship Principles
- Character over merit.
- Facing life challanges with adaptability, tenacity and resilience, instead of complaints.
